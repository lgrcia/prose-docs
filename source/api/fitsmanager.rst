Fits Manager
============

|prose| provides a :py:class:`~prose.FitsManager` class to deal with fits folder exploration, mainly to identify and retrieve calibration files
associated with specific observations. This class is heavily used and comes handy to deal with unorganized fits folders (e.g. where there is no separation between multiple observations, science and calibration images)
