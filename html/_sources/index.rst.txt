|prose| is a tool to build pipelines dedicated to astronomical images processing, :underline:`only based on pip installable dependencies` (e.g. no IRAF, Sextractor or Astrometry.net install needed ðŸŽ‰). It features default pipelines to perform common tasks (such as automated calibration, reduction and photometry) and makes building custom ones easy.
