What is a pipeline?
===================

A *pipeline*, strictly speaking, is a series of connected tubes running a fluid. In the scientific literature, the word refers to `processing pipelines <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)>`_ in which data are flowing, going through processing units as in tubes. |prose| contains the structure to build modular image processing pipelines with three key objects: ``Images`` going through ``Blocks`` assembled in ``Sequences``.

Image, Block and Sequence
-------------------------------------

.. image:: _static/image.png

An ``Image`` object contains the ``Image.data`` as well as metadata in ``Image.header``. A ``Block`` is a single unit of processing acting on the ``Image`` object, which can |read| and |write| any of its attributes or |modify|. Finally a ``Sequence`` is a succesion of ``Block``.

With this architecture |prose| can deal with any type of FITS images (check ``Telescope`` object next).

Example: Hello world
--------------------

Let's have a random set of images

.. code:: python

    from prose import Image, Block, Sequence
    import numpy as np
    
    np.random.seed(42)
    images = [Image(data=np.random.rand(10,10)) for i in range(5)]

Here is a block printing hello world and the image mean

.. code:: python

    class HelloWorld(Block):
        def run(self, image):
            image.mean = np.mean(image.data)
            print(f"Hello world (mean: {image.mean:.2f})")

and running a sequence with it

.. code:: python

    sequence = Sequence([
        HelloWorld(),
    ])

    sequence.run(images)

    RUN Hello world: 100%|█████████████████████| 5/5 [00:00<00:00, 15720.78 images/s
